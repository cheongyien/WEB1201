        <h2>Characteristics of a Sagittarius</h2>
        <p> Curious and energetic, Sagittarius is one of the biggest travelers among all zodiac signs. Their open mind and philosophical view motivates them to wander around the world in search of the meaning of life.Sagittarius is extrovert, optimistic and enthusiastic, and likes changes. Sagittarius-born are able to transform their thoughts into concrete actions and they will do anything to achieve their goals.</p>
        <br><br>

        <h2> Love Match </h2>
        Ruled by expansive Jupiter, Sagittarius is big-hearted, open, and always looking beyond a checklist. A Sagittarius rarely has a “type,”— they are always intrigued by the individual, and don’t make any assumptions about people until they’ve truly met and spoken with them.<br><br>

        <h2> Career & Money </h2>

        Work-life balance. A Sagittarius may work hard and push themselves to the max, but only because they love their job. A Sag instinctively knows that work can help them live their best life, and works hard so they can also play hard. They definitely use up all vacation days!<br><br>

        <h2> Health </h2>
        Pushing beyond their breaking point. A Sagittarius person sometimes thinks that admitting pain is giving up, and will push far past the point of discomfort, which can sometimes backfire.
