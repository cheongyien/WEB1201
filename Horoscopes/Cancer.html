        <h2>Characteristics of a Cancer</h2>
        <p> Deeply intuitive and sentimental, Cancer can be one of the most challenging zodiac signs to get to know. They are very emotional and sensitive, and care deeply about matters of the family and their home. Cancer is sympathetic and attached to people they keep close. Those born in Cancer are very loyal and able to empathize with other people's pain and suffering.</p><br><br>

        <h2> Love Match </h2>
       You normally enjoy a soft romantic outlook, as far as your love life is concerned. Situations that you get yourself into may seem to be devoid of real feeling to make any significant impression on you. However, you will enjoy meeting with others who have a more experimental approach to love, and though this may not lead to anything deep and intimate, you could make some warm and wonderful friends.<br><br>

        <h2> Career & Money </h2>

       Taking emotion out of the equation. In some ways, Cancers' emotional connection to their work is an asset. When they feel passion, they will pull countless all-nighters to finish a project. But there's a flip side: When Cancers don't care about something or disagree with their higher-ups about how a project should be handled, they may lash out passive-aggressively by delivering sloppy work. Learning how to divest their emotions from assignments (particularly the less-than-inspiring ones) can help Cancer get ahead.<br><br>

        <h2> Health </h2>
       Cancer's are very sensitive and vulnerable, they are prone to emotional disruptions. They easily get depressed and can be very pessimistic. They may also be susceptible to gastric problems, heartburn and obesity.
