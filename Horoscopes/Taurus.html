        <h2>Characteristics of an Taurus</h2>
        <p> Practical and well-grounded, Taurus is the sign that harvests the fruits of labor. They feel the need to always be surrounded by love and beauty, turned to the material world, hedonism, and physical pleasures. People born with in Taurus are sensual and tactile, considering touch and taste the most important of all senses. Stable and conservative, this is one of the most reliable signs of the zodiac, ready to endure and stick to their choices until they reach the point of personal satisfaction.</p><br><br>

        <h2> Love Match </h2>
        Ruled by Venus, Taureans are sensual to the max and very connected to their physical bodies. A Taurus must feel physical attraction from the start if a romance is going to take off. But those who want to seduce Taurus first have to get past the formidable external barriers this sign places in front of them. <br><br>

        <h2> Career & Money </h2>

        Persistence. A Taurus will look at a project, break it down into steps, and get things done, even if it means burning the midnight oil. Taurus never utters the words "too busy" and quickly becomes a cherished member of any work team.<br><br>

        <h2> Health </h2>
       Belief that taking medicine is giving up and seeing a doctor is a sign of failure. Stubborn Bulls sometimes have a hard time accepting medical advice and may try DIY cures or just ignoring the problem away.
