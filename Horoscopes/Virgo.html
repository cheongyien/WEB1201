        <h2>Characteristics of a Virgo</h2>
        <p> Virgos are always paying attention to the smallest details and their deep sense of humanity makes them one of the most careful signs of the zodiac. Their methodical approach to life ensures that nothing is left to chance, and although they are often tender, their heart might be closed for the outer world. This is a sign often misunderstood, not because they lack the ability to express, but because they wonâ€™t accept their feelings as valid, true, or even relevant when opposed to reason. The symbolism behind the name speaks well of their nature, born with a feeling they are experiencing everything for the first time.</p><br><br>

        <h2> Love Match </h2>
        Virgo loves hard, and is always in pursuit of star love the kind where souls, minds, and bodies seamlessly merge. That's why this sign sometimes gets the (unfair) reputation of being too picky. They're not they just know exactly what they're looking for, and know that settling for someone good enough will mean that they'll never find the love that their body and soul crave.<br><br>

        <h2> Career & Money </h2>
         Intelligence. Fiercely intelligent, Virgos are a manager's dream because they can both see the big picture and focus in on the tiny details to make a project work.<br><br>

        <h2> Health </h2>
        Boutique gym classes. Virgo loves the adrenaline rush of an intense class, often taking classes back to back. They also adore boutique classes with individualized instruction, which may do a number on their bank account.
