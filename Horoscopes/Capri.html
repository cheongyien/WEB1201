        <h2>Characteristics of a Capricorn</h2>
        <p> Capricorn is a sign that represents time and responsibility, and its representatives are traditional and often very serious by nature. These individuals possess an inner state of independence that enables significant progress both in their personal and professional lives. They are masters of self-control and have the ability to lead the way, make solid and realistic plans, and manage many people who work for them at any time. They will learn from their mistakes and get to the top based solely on their experience and expertise.</p>
        <br><br>

        <h2> Love Match </h2>
       Persistent Capricorn approaches love as serious business. As the zodiac’s most goal-oriented sign, you’re not one to play around. Chances are, you’ve got a 10-year plan for your life, and your partner must forward that agenda. Flings aren’t really your bag; you’d rather be alone than jump from partner to partner.<br><br>

        <h2> Career & Money </h2>

        Determination. A Capricorn will push themselves beyond their limits to get a job done on time. A Capricorn will not take “no” for an answer, either from themselves or from an underling, and knows that there is always a way to do the impossible.<br><br>

        <h2> Health </h2>
        Capricorns can sometimes get annoyed at their body, and may need to really learn how to focus on tuning into their body and what it needs. Mind-body awareness can help keep certain physical ailments at bay, and more importantly, can help Caps catch a problem before it becomes a major issue.
