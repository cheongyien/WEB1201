        <h2>Characteristics of a Pisces</h2>
        <p> Pisces are very friendly, so they often find themselves in a company of very different people. 
        Pisces are selfless, they are always willing to help others, without hoping to get anything back.
        Pisces is a Water sign and as such this zodiac sign is characterized by empathy and expressed emotional capacity.</p><br><br>

        <h2> Love Match </h2>
        Deep within the Piscean beats the heart of the diehard romantic. Loving, tender, and exceptionally giving, this sign cherishes intimacy deeply. They are passionate lovers that need to feel a real connection with their mates. Quick flings and superficial interludes do not bide well for the Piscean whatsoever.<br><br>

        <h2> Career & Money </h2>

        Intuitive and often dreamy, the Piscean is most comfortable in positions that bring their creative natures into humanitarian causes. Some good careers for this sign are lawyer, architect, veterinarian, musician, social worker, and game designer. The key phrase for this sign is "I believe." It's important for the Piscean to feel strongly about their endeavors.<br><br>

        <h2> Health </h2>
       The Pisces natives have perhaps the most delicate physical structure. Their feet, respiratory and circulation systems can cause worries. Besides, they are very sensitive people, and easily take to junk food – which can lead to weight gain – and can also lead to addictions. Even minor seasonal changes can adversely affect their health.
