        <h2>Characteristics of a Libra</h2>
        <p> People born under the sign of Libra are peaceful, fair, and they hate being alone. Partnership is very important for them, as their mirror and someone giving them the ability to be the mirror themselves. These individuals are fascinated by balance and symmetry, they are in a constant chase for justice and equality, realizing through life that the only thing that should be truly important to themselves in their own inner core of personality. This is someone ready to do nearly anything to avoid conflict, keeping the peace whenever possible</p><br><br>

        <h2> Love Match </h2>
        Libra adores flirting, loves the drama and pageantry of romance, and is one of the few signs of the Zodiac that actually enjoys first dates. While Libras excel at charming potential partners, they have difficulty figuring out what they want, and all too often can get lost in the twists and turns of a relationship. Because of this, a Libra will sometimes hold back on falling in love, worried that partnership equals loss of self. Libra's partner has to be understanding if this sign seems to pull back.<br><br>

        <h2> Career & Money </h2>

        Imagination. For a Libra, work can be a playground. If this sign works with a great team and on projects they believe in, their job is fun. Librans love dreaming up new projects to accomplish and challenges to meet.<br><br>

        <h2> Health </h2>
        Short-term fixes. From downing caffeine-laden drinks to eating a ton of sugar, Libra often seeks energy in external, unhealthy ways, only to crash hard later.
