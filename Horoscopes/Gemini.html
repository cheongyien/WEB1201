        <h2>Characteristics of a Gemini</h2>
        <p> Expressive and quick-witted, Gemini represents two different personalities in one and you will never be sure which one you will face. They are sociable, communicative and ready for fun, with a tendency to suddenly get serious, thoughtful and restless. They are fascinated with the world itself, extremely curious, with a constant feeling that there is not enough time to experience everything they want to see.</p><br><br>

        <h2> Love Match </h2>
        Dynamic, intense, and with so many shifting parts to their personalities, Gemini love to date. Indeed, they consider dating a skill. Gemini are great at drawing first dates out of their shells, and they rarely have a "bad" dateâ€”because this optimism-infused sign will always finds something positive about the person they meet or the conversation they shared.<br><br>

        <h2> Career & Money </h2>

        Communication. Inspired by Mercury the messenger, Gemini is an amazing communicator who knows innately how to present ideas for approval. Whether it's standing in front of a meeting, delivering a killer deck, or writing an amazing article, Gemini is a master wordsmith who can either find success in an individualized field (such as writing) or as part of a larger team.<br><br>

        <h2> Health </h2>
        Gemini put their hands over their ears and pretends that things aren't happening. While dissociating can be a helpful skill, being fully present in one's own body (and at the doctor's office) is an essential skill for Gemini to maintain their best health.
