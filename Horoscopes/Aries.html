        <h2>Characteristics of a Aries</h2>
        <p> Aries always marks the beginning of something energetic and turbulent. They are continuously looking for dynamic, speed and competition, always being the first in everything - from work to social gatherings.Aries is one of the most active zodiac signs. It is in their nature to take action, sometimes before they think about it well.</p><br><br>

        <h2> Love Match </h2>
			In love, Aries is a one-on-one person. You can never get too much attention or solo time with your sweetie. You’ll put your partner first in all matters, and you expect the same in return. If your mate’s universe doesn’t include a starring role for you, there’s simply no point in being together.<br><br>

        <h2> Career & Money </h2>
		Career is the area of life where Aries is apt to shine the brightest. Ambitious, creative, and often driven by the need to be the best they can be, the Ram is at their best in the workplace. Born leaders, Aries are far more comfortable taking charge than taking orders. They thrive as a manager and will often find their colleagues coming to them for advice.
		<br><br>
	
        <h2> Health </h2>
      Aries recklessness and impatience to get things done in a rush and inability to finish off what they started, leaves them under stress, often affecting their food habits and health.
